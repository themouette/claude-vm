# Claude VM Project Context

This is the Claude VM project - a Rust CLI tool for running Claude Code in isolated Lima VMs.

## Architecture

- **Config system**: Layered precedence (CLI > env > project > global > defaults)
- **Capabilities**: Modular TOML-based system for tools (docker, node, python, etc.)
- **Runtime scripts**: Execute before each Claude session for environment setup
- **Context generation**: Automatic VM configuration context for Claude

## Key Components

- `src/config.rs`: Configuration loading and merging
- `src/capabilities/`: Capability definitions and registry
- `src/scripts/runner.rs`: Runtime script execution and context generation
- `src/vm/`: VM lifecycle management (Lima integration)

## Development Guidelines

- Include code examples when explaining functionality
- Follow Rust best practices and idioms
- Use proper error handling with Result types
- Test configuration merging and precedence
- Always run tests, format and clippy before creating a commit if rust code was changed

## Tools available

The setup script located in `bin/setup` has been executed so you should be able
to access tools needed to run, compile and develop the project.

SSH agent is not available in the VM so you cannot interact with the remote
repository, but you can use `gh` to open and read pull requests or issues.
